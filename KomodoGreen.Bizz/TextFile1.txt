KomodoGreen.BLL 
Your Business Logic Layer will have all of your business logic. It will do the heavy lifting in your app 

that includes CRUD + Lists.  It will check with the .Data models to ensure that business rules are being 
followed. These files will look a lot like our repository pattern code last week. 

It’s important to note that this layer only cares about a couple things:
What is in the .Data models.
What the service contracts are dictating.

Note: You should not have any Console Statements in this portion of the application. This layer should not 
care about what other layer is going to use it.  This would ideally be a reusable layer to be used by a different 
UI without difficulty, such as an MVC app or a WebAPI.
